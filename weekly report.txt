The Floating Cells/Clusters Search: Topologically detached cells/clusters may be found during the evolution of the profile in the feature model. The detachment refers to the floating cells/clusters which are not connected to the "base" structure and will fall due to the gravity. Floating cells/clusters cause some numerically problems for feature model. For example, there is no surface normal which can be defined on a floating single cell, which all its neighbors are in vacuum. Therefore, search for floating cells/clusters need to be done every time when the mesh/geometry is updated. Mathematically, the detachment search is not easy. In the feature model, we implement a surface searching algorithm to address most common scenarios. Firstly, surface nodes are searched globally, in which each node is checked if one of its neighbors belongs to vacuum. Secondly, surface nodes are searched in chain, in which the search starts from the leftmost surface node and proceed only with its neighbors. The difference between global search and chain search are the floating cells/clusters, which will be dropped by gravity. This algorithm works well in the feature model.
