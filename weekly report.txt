Yield Larger than One in Feature Model: In current Feature Model, a particle is able to etch a cell when hitting the cell. The "etch" here means that the materials of the cell is changed from solid, such as Si, to vacuum. When a particle hits a solid cell, there are usually more than one possible reactions which could occur. A dice is rolled to determine the one to occur. If "etch" is selected, a single cell is etched, which results in yield of one. However, measurements from real experiments show that yield can be larger than one, especially with high energy. Material surface can be loosened by ion bombardment. When a particle hits such a surface, it is possible to kick out more than one atoms/molecules. Represented by the Feature Model, more than one cells can be "etched". The "hit" cell is by default to be etched. And one or more of its neighbors, depending on the yield, can be chosen to be "etched" as well. Eventually, the yield obtained from the Feature Model will be aligned with the experimental results. We are still on the detailed investigation.
