Geometry and Mesh Generator: Within Langmuir model, there are three individual models, 2D reactor model, 1D reactor model and 2D feature model. These three models support different applications and are developed separately. In order to address the more complicated applications which requires coupling between these models and meanwhile maintain the model in one place, a universal geometry and mesh generator is needed. The generator algorithm is designed in Python and will be implemented in C/C++. The geometry generator consists of domain, which defines the computational domain and boundaries, and shapes, which are the basic elements, such as interval for 1D and rectangle for 2D. The default material for the domain is set to be "Plasma". Any added shapes overwrite the domain with new materials, such as "Metal" or "Dielectric". Mesh generator imports the geometry and generate structured mesh grids on it. Corresponding materials will be assigned to the nodes, which are inside shapes. The unified geometry and mesh generator is tested with all the these models and works well.
