The feature model runtime profile: the investigation of runtime of the feature model is continued. Surface normal calculation and reflection modules are added to the Python-version feature model. Surface normal calculation significantly increases the runtime, which surpasses the "particle move and hit check" functions. Surface normal is currently calculated by fitting a line(in 2D) or a plane (in 3D) to nearby neighbors. The fitting parameters are determined by minimizing the cost function, which is constructed as the sum of distance of the nearby neighbors to the line or plane. The runtime, as well as the surface normal, depends in a large degree on the range of "nearby". Contrary to one's intuition, the "accuracy" of the surface normal is not proportional to the range of "nearby", where larger range could introduce more noises. The runtime increases almost exponentially with the range. A deep investigation is needed in order to optimize the surface normal calculation.
