Sheath Model with Dual Frequency: In modern manufacturing processes, a plasma reactor is required to run tens of etching processes, in which different materials and patterns are etched. Dual frequency is therefore used either for source or bias to expand the process window. For example, ion energy can be extended to higher end by dual frequency.  The sheath model is required to resolve the dual frequency. In the sheath model, we added two modules. One of them supports dual sinusoidal functions, like V_shÌ±íat‚Ñé=max‚Å°(V_dc+V_freq1  sin‚Å°(œâ_freq1 t)+V_freq2  sin‚Å°(œâ_freq2 t), 0). The coupling of the two frequencies depends on the frequencies and their voltages. The other module supports read-in from the reactor model. In principle, it is compatiable to any readable data form. As long as the sheath voltage is imported to the model, the module can interpolate the voltage form as a function of time. The two modules are verified numerically. The first module is tested with a seriers of combinations of frequqncies and voltages. Due to lack of experimental data, the validation is not done yet. But the impact of frequency on the ion energy is able to be revealed in the sheath model.
