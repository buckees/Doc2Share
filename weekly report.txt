The ICP field solver test in Cartesian Coordinate: To test the ICP field solver, a 2-wire system is setup, in which there is analytic solution. The wire is infinite long with current flowing through. The magnetic field lines of a single infinite wire are circular and centered at the wire and they are identical in every plane perpendicular to the wire. Since the field decreases with distance from the wire, the spacing of the field lines must increase correspondingly with distance. The magnetic field of 2-wire system is simply vector summation of the solutions of two single wires. The field solver solves for the magnetic vector potential and compute magnetic field through a curl operator. The results are compared to the analytic solution and a good agreement is found. It proves that our vector potential solver is correct in Cartesian coordinate. The next step is to test the solver in Cylindrical coordinate.
