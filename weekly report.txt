The electron energy equation: In plasma fluid module, the transport coefficients, such as diffusion coefficient and mobility, are all dependent on electron temperature, which is obtained by solving the electron energy equation. Similar to the continuity equation, electron energy equation, d(3/2 n_e T_e )/dt+∇⋅Q=P_input−P_loss, also includes the flux term and source term. The energy flux, Q, consists of convection and conduction. Since the they both have the same equation structure, the solver for continuity equation is used for the electron energy equation. The input power is assumed as constant and uniform for now, and will be coupled to ICP solver in the next phase. Power loss due to reactions is ignored for now. After implementation, electron temperature is obtained and found a double-peak profile. In the next step, the results will be verified and validated.
