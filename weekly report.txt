The feature model benchmark: The feature model has been developed for two months and basic functions are completed. In order to evaluate the current status of the feature model development, a model benchmark, in which MCFPM2D is used, is conducted. A base case, where Si is etched and PR is used to define the pattern, is setup. Only Ar+ ions, with energy of 50 eV and flux of 1e17 1/m2s, are launched. When Ar+ hits the PR, it reflects; While Ar+ hits the Si, there is 50% chance that it etches the Si, otherwise reflects. The initial angular distribution uses Consine/Lambertian distribution, assuming low sheath potential. Due to the wide angular distribution, the etched profile exhibits bowing under the PR. The bowing CD increases with input maximum angle. When Ar+ etches through the Si to the bottom (SiO2). Ion reflection probability increases significantly and a back scattering phenomena is observed. Qualitatively, the Langmuir model agrees well with the MCFPM2D. Quantitative benchmark requires more detailed setup and depends on the numerical algorithms in each model.
