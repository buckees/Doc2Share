The feature model parallelization: the feature model uses Monte Carlo method, in which particles are released from the top boundary and move until hit the material surface. The Monte Carlo method provides a fairly simple implementation algorithm, however, with the cost of high computational load. In order for recipe tuning, computing speed is extremely important. Parallelization of the particle launch is the common way to accelerate the feature model. There are several parallelization algorithms available, such as step-wise and cell-wise methods. Runtime profile needs to be done before choosing the best parallelization algorithm. In the Python-version feature model, runtime is recorded. 10,000 particles are launched and most of the time is expended in the first 2 loops for "hit check". After that, particles are dramatically reduced by 70% due to getting out of boundaries. The sum of all remaining loops are still less than the first 2 loops, which means that optimizing the first 2 loops will benefit most. Our research shows that the runtime profile is the key for success of parallelization. We are going to complete and calibrate the runtime of the Python-version feature model in the next step.
