Feature Model C-version Design: As the Python-version Feature Model gets mature, the conversion of Python to C/C++ is about to start. Python code is known for its built-in classes and packages. In C/C++, we need write most of the basic functions ourselves, such as random number generator and distribution functions. To distribute the jobs to programmers, we need to well design the Feature Model structure. The fundamental level consists of basic functions, which should be as general as possible. They are to solve mathematical problems, with no association with any physics. Random number generator is a perfect example of the fundamental functions. The function performance, such as speed and memory, is the key requirement. The next level is to define the common classes which are shared with all Langmuir models, which are Reactor Model, Sheath Model and Feature Model. The classes, such as Mesh and Particle, in this level are placed in /model/commons.  Within each model, Mesh and Particle are called to complete the model algorithm. Meanwhile, Utest and Stest are designed to test the fundamental functions and common classes. The input and output controls are packaged together for the whole Langmuir project. The overall design is now good to use and details will be improved while programmers contribute to it.
