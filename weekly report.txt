Sheath Model: As the Reactor model and Feature model all run well in python version, the priority of Sheath model is now moved forward. Sheath model serves as a connector between Reactor model and Feature model. It takes the E-filed and species from the Reactor model and compute the angular and energy distribution of electrons and ions, which is fed into the Feature model as input. Sheath model uses particle tracing algorithm and basically traces particles under varying E-field. Particle collisions are taken into account and they widen the distribution of angle. In the code structure, modules from Feature model, such as particle and move, can be shared with Sheath model.  The first step is to construct an model for collsionless  sheath in the next two weeks.
