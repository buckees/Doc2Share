Reactor Model in 2D Cartesian Symmetry: Based on the 1D plasma model, a 2D reactor model is developed with Cartesian symmetry, which is simpler for implementation than Cylindrical symmetry. In Cartesian symmetry, we could focus on proving the algorithms and lay down the foundation for Cylindrical symmetry. In this 2D reactor model, all necessary modules are developed and connected. The continuity module is solved using ambipolar diffusion assumption, which uses semi-implicit method and a large timestep is allowed. The electron energy equation is solved so that diffusion coefficients and reaction coefficients can be updated according to electron temperature. The reaction module is calculated assuming explicit electron temperature dependence. ICP field module is assume uniformly across the chamber, since ICP field solver is developed separately. All these modules are connected iteratively. A simulation of ICP in Ar is demonstrated and show the success of the 2D reactor model.
