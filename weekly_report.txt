Surface Normal Calculation: In Feature Model, the surface normal calculation is a frequently called function, which is second to particle tracing. Whenever a particle hits a material cell, the surface normal is calculated and then fed to the probability calculation. Either reflection or reaction depends on the incoming angle with respect to surface normal. The algorithms calculating the surface normal has been discussed before. During the last week, main effort has been put to implement the algorithms. The biggest challenge is to avoid the near-zero subtraction in Jacobian matrix. With normal Eigenvector setup, the Langmuir Model has to be compiled with double precision, which is not efficient, to get the right results. By digging into the eigenvector, we found a special expression of Eigenvector setup, which can handle the near-zero subtraction internally without requiring the whole model as double precision. Now the surface normal is successfully installed and benchmarked with our python code.
