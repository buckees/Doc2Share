Charge Exchange Collision for Sheath Model: Charge exchange collision is added to Sheath Model. The dominating type of collisions in the sheath is charge exchange between ions and neutrals, in which an electron is transferred, making the ion a neutral particle and the neutral particle an ion. Not only the cross section of charge exchange collision is large, but also the energy loss due to charge exchange is significant. When an energetic ion exchange charge with a neutral, the ion becomes a neutral particle which preserves the original energy. The created "new" ion is now at the thermal equilibrium energy. Since the Sheath Model only tracks ions, the ultimate result is that the ion loses all its kinetic energy and becomes a "thermal" ion. The angle after charge exchange collision is random due to thermal equilibrium. By adding charge exchange collision into Sheath Model, the 1st-order collision contribution is completed.
