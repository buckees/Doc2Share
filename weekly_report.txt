Ambipolar Assumption for Reactor Model: Ambipolar assumption is implemented in Reactor Model to solve for steady state. The current explicit method used in the model limits the timestep to 1e-12 s or even smaller. It makes the model difficult to reach steady state, which is usually on the scale from 10's microseconds to miliseconds. An implicit method could concur the timestep limit but is not easy to implement any time soon. A compromise is reached to use the ambipolar assumption, which could raise the timestep up to microseconds with a quick implementation. The drawback is that only steady state is solved. Any transition or dynamics of the plasmas is not addressed. In a demo case, the fluid equations are solved much faster than explicit method by a factor of about 1000. The steady state is in a good agreement with slow explicit method.
