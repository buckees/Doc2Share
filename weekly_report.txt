Sheath Model with Angular Distribution: Angular distribution is added to the Sheath Model. The particle in the model is defined in 3D space, including both position and velocity. Because the electric field from the Reactor Model is 2D, so the results in Sheath Model represent a 2D distribution. The angle in the Sheath Model is defined as the angle between the velocity and the downward direction, (0, -1, 0). The velocity of particle is tracked. For plots, the velocity is converted to energy and angle. The solver of Newton's equation, such as Leapfrog method, naturally supports 3D particle trajectory. Usually, the angular distribution will be narrowed by the electric field within the sheath. For example, assuming 100 V sheath voltage across a sheath thickness of 2.0 mm, the initial angular distribution at the sheath edge, which ranges from -20 degree to 20 degree, is narrowed down to range from -2 degree to 2 degree at the wafer surface due to sheath acceleration. If electric field is not perpendicular to wafer surface, the average angle of the angular distribution will tilt accordingly. With both energy and angle information, the Feature Model now is able to be coupled to Sheath Model.
