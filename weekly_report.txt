Particle Reflection on Surface: Particle reflection can be a complex process involving interaction of the particle and the solid surface. The interaction is in theory determined by the state of particle, such as energy and incoming angle, and the state of the surface, such as surface normal, surface roughness. Before diving into the complexity, two extreme reflections, specular and diffusive reflections, are implemented in the Feature Model. Other kind of reflection can be mimicked by combining the specular and diffusive reflections with some coefficient. The specular reflection is simple since it mirrors the incoming angle. The diffusive reflection uses Lambertian distribution instead of uniform distribution by assuming the outgoing flux is independent of the angle view of the observer. Both specular and diffusive reflections are benchmarked and verified by the Michigan code.
