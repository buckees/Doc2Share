Connecting Sheath Mode to Feature Model: In Langmuir Model, the Sheath Model serves as a connector to connect Reactor Model to Feature Model. Last week, the connection between Sheath Model and Feature Model was tested. The Sheath Model outputs velocity distribution, which is used by the Feature Model as initial condition. The velocity resolution is determined by the number of particles launched in the Sheath Model. As the particles are collected on the wafer, their velocities are recorded and saved to an array, size of which ranges from 10K to 1M. The array is passed to Feature Model and works as a pool for random selection. In Feature Model, a random integer is generated and determines the velocity for a launched particle. After the velocity initiation, there is no more impact from the Sheath Model. Several scenarios were tested for the connection and the results appear well aligned.
