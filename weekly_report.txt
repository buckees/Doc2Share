Testing Cases Setup for Langmuir Project: Now the Reactor Model, Sheath Model and Feature Model are developed in parallel and regularly updated. Some updates are only for individual models, while others can run across models. In order to check and test all updates, a batch of standard testing cases are needed. Firstly, testing cases should be simple and run-fast since the total number of tests could grow big as the project develops. Secondly, each testing case should address only one or two issues so that an error can be easily identified if any. Thirdly, testing cases need to be verified with existing models, such as MCFPM or S-TOPO. By last week, 2 testing cases for reactor model, 5 testing cases for feature model and 3 testing cases for sheath model have been setup and 50% of them have been verified with MCFPM. The test for reactor model takes about 10 mins while the test for sheath and feature models are much faster. The setup of testing cases will be continued.
