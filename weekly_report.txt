C-Version Feature Model: The barebone C-version Feature Model has been implemented and tested recently. The current model consists of particle generation, particle tracing, and particle-material reaction. Particle generation is able to load the results from the Sheath Model. It can also work alone by using built-in pre-defined energy and angular distribution. Particle tracing tracks the particle from releasing to termination. A step-wise algorithm is used and step size is usually chosen as half of the cell size. Particle-material reaction is fairly complicated and not done yet. To test the model, the reaction is set to a simple one, in which only Si is etched with 100% probability. Several test cases were set up and compared to python-version model. The results agree qualitatively and look reasonable. An average case in C takes less than 10 sec, faster by a factor > 100 than python-version model. A quantitative comparison will be conducted and benchmark will be done with Michigan model.
