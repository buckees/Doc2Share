Mesh and Material in C Structure: Mesh and materials modules are placed in the common directory and are designed to support both Reactor and Feature Models. Sheath model requires only domain information, instead of mesh. The basic function of mesh and material is to read information from the user-defined input file and construct a mesh with material assignment. For Reactor Model, both the mesh and materials will never change after the construction. For Feature model, the material assignment is constantly changed during the feature evolution while mesh remains. Therefore, mesh and material are defined in separate files. Mesh file contains all the information associated with geometry, such as domain size and resolution. Material file determines the material assignment to each node. With such a design, all sub-models within Langmuir Model can share the same mesh and material classes.
